Gene Saver

TODO:
- precommit
- deploy
- dockerize


Thoughts to track:
- ec2 instead of eks because it was free, but not recommended 
- should use terraform so changes are not overwritten/lost
- could use a rds proxy for scalability or rds aurora + proxy to get reader and writer nodes (again for scalability or data concerns)
